Since `assets/models/characters.glb` is a binary file format for a 3D model and not a text-based code file, it's not possible to generate code for it. GLB files are typically created using 3D modeling software and contain 3D models and animations that can be imported into a Three.js scene.

However, if you were to reference this file within a Three.js script to load the model, it would look something like this:

```javascript
const loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();
loader.load('assets/models/characters.glb', function (gltf) {
    scene.add(gltf.scene);
}, undefined, function (error) {
    console.error(error);
});
```

This code snippet uses Three.js's `GLTFLoader` to load the `characters.glb` file and add it to the scene. The actual `.glb` file would be created in a 3D modeling program like Blender, exported, and then placed in the `assets/models/` directory to be accessed by the Three.js application.
