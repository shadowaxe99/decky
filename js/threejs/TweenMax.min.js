// TweenMax.min.js is a part of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and is not something that can be generated as it is a third-party library.
// However, you can download TweenMax from the official GreenSock website or include it via a CDN in your HTML file.
// Below is an example of how you might include TweenMax via CDN in your index.html file:

// In your index.html file, include the following script tag to use TweenMax from a CDN:
/*
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.9.1/gsap.min.js"></script>
*/

// Since I cannot generate the actual TweenMax code, as it is copyrighted material, the above method is the recommended way to include TweenMax in your project.
