// dat.gui.min.js is a lightweight controller library for JavaScript.
// It allows you to easily manipulate variables and fire functions on the fly.
// This library is minified and should be included as is.
// Since it's a third-party library, we do not generate its code.
// Instead, you can download the minified version from the official repository or include it via a CDN.

// For the purpose of this task, we will assume that the dat.gui.min.js file is already present in the project.
// If you need to include it in your HTML file, you can use the following script tag:

// <script src="js/threejs/dat.gui.min.js"></script>

// Please download the actual dat.gui.min.js from the dat.gui GitHub repository or include it via a CDN in your project.
