// Function to support thousands of students simultaneously
function buildInfrastructure() {
  // Placeholder for infrastructure logic
  // This function would handle the setup of servers, databases, and other backend systems
  // to support a large number of concurrent users in the Elysium OS metaverse.
  // The actual implementation would involve setting up cloud services, load balancers,
  // and efficient data management systems to ensure scalability and performance.

  // Example: Initialize server connections, database pools, etc.
}

// Function to ensure adaptability of the platform
function ensureAdaptability() {
  // Placeholder for adaptability logic
  // This function would ensure that Elysium OS can seamlessly integrate with existing systems
  // and adapt to various devices and platforms. It would involve creating APIs, SDKs, and
  // responsive design to make the platform accessible everywhere.

  console.log('Ensuring adaptability of Elysium OS across different systems and platforms...');
  // Example: Set up responsive design, cross-platform compatibility checks, etc.
}

// Function to enhance accessibility
function enhanceAccessibility() {
  // Placeholder for accessibility logic
  // This function would focus on making Elysium OS accessible to all users, including those
  // with disabilities. It would involve implementing accessibility standards, such as WCAG,
  // and testing with assistive technologies.

  console.log('Enhancing accessibility for all users in Elysium OS...');
  // Example: Implement ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, etc.
}

// Export functions for use in other modules

// Initialize infrastructure on app start
buildInfrastructure();

// Note: The above code is a placeholder and represents the structure of the infrastructure.js file.
// Actual implementation details would require backend development and are not included in this frontend-focused example.
